# AlgoExpert (Ace the Coding Interview)
This repository contains my solutions to the coding problems on [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io).

The solutions are coded in C++ and compiled using the g++ compiler in Ubuntu. Each file has a problem description inserted as a comment. Each file also contains a sample test case, to test the code run the following commands in the terminal form the correct working directory
```
g++ -o output <filename.cpp>
./output
```
